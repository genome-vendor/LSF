=head1 NAME

LSF::JobManager - submit and wait for a set of LSF Jobs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use LSF RaiseError => 0, PrintError => 1, PrintOutput => 0;
    use LSF::JobManager;

    my $m = LSF::JobManager->new(-q=>'small');

    my $job = $m->submit("echo hello");
    $m->submit("echo world");
    
    for my $job ($m->jobs){
        $job->top;
    }
    
    $m->wait_all_children;
    print "All children have completed!\n";

    for ($m->jobs_with_status('EXIT') ){
        print "Job with id $_ exited non zero\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<LSF::JobManager> provides a simple mechanism to submit a set of command lines
to the LSF Batch system and then wait for them all to finish in a blocking
(efficient) manner. Additionally, the LSF Batch system can be polled for jobs of
particular status and those jobs are returned as LSF::Job objects; This is an 
inefficient way to wait for all jobs to complete but can be used to determine 
which jobs have a particular status.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item new ( [ ARGS ] )

$manager = LSF::JobManager->new(-q=>'small'
                               ,-m=>'mymachine');

Creates a new C<LSF::JobManager> object.

Any parameters are used as defaults passed to the submit method.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item $manager->submit( [ [ ARGS ] ], [CMD] )

Submits a command line to LSF. This is a wrapper around the LSF::Job->submit
call. The required argument is the command line to submit. Optional arguments
override the defaults given to C<new>. The submitted LSF::Job object is returned
on success, otherwise undef is returned, $? and $@ set. See C<LSF::Job>

=item $manager->wait_all_children()

Waits for all previously submitted LSF Jobs to complete in a blocking manner

=item $manager->jobs_with_status( [ [ STATUS_FLAGS ] ] )

Returns an array of jobs matching the given status flags (see LSF documentation)
The default flag is 'EXIT', returning an array of LSF::Job objects representing
command lines that exited non zero.

=item $manager->params()

Returns an array of the parameters that were passed to new

=item $manager->jobs()

Returns an array of the submitted LSF::Job objects.

=head1 HISTORY

The B<LSF::Batch> module on cpan didn't compile easily on all platforms i wanted.
The LSF API didn't seem very perlish either. As a quick fix I knocked these
modules together which wrap the LSF command line interface. It was enough for
my simple usage. Hopefully they work in a much more perly manner.
