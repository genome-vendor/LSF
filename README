NAME
       LSF - load various LSF modules

SYNOPSIS
           use LSF;
           use LSF PRINT => 1;


DESCRIPTION
       "LSF" provides a simple mechanism to load some of the LSF
       modules at one time.  Currently this includes:

             LSF::Job
             LSF::JobInfo
             LSF::JobGroup
             LSF::Queue

       Turning on or off the printing of LSF command line output
       can be controlled globally via the 'print' directive to
       the LSF module. Otherwise it can be set individually in
       each of the LSF modules by using its 'PRINT' directive or
       by calling its 'print' class method

       For more information on any of these modules, please see
       its respective documentation.

       NOTE: FOR THESE MODULES TO WORK IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU
       INCLUDE THE LSF COMMANDS IN YOUR PATH.

HISTORY
       The LSF::Batch module on cpan didn't compile easily on all
       platforms i wanted.  The LSF API didn't seem very perlish
       either. As a quick fix I knocked these modules together
       which wrap the LSF command line interface. It was enough
       for my simple usage. Hopefully they work in a much more
       perly manner.
