NAME
       LSF - load various LSF modules

SYNOPSIS
           use LSF;
           use LSF RaiseError => 1, PrintError => 1, PrintOutput => 1;


DESCRIPTION
       This is the base class of the LSF suite of modules. 'use
       LSF' will also preload all of the LSF modules at one time.
       Currently this includes:

             LSF::Job
             LSF::JobInfo
             LSF::JobGroup
             LSF::Queue
             LSF::JobManager

       Two error reporting strategies are available and can be
       set globally via the 'use LSF' statement or individually
       in each of the LSF modules. By setting the 'RaiseError'
       directive to true, or by using the RaiseError class
       method, the LSF modules will die on error, otherwise they
       will return false, setting $? to the exit value and $@ to
       the stderr of the LSF command line. Additionally the
       printing of LSF command line stdout and stderr can be con-
       trolled via the 'PrintOutput' and 'PrintError' directives
       or class methods of the same names.  Defaults are as
       above.

       For more information on any of these modules, please see
       its respective documentation.

       NOTE: FOR THESE MODULES TO WORK IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU
       INCLUDE THE LSF COMMAND LINES IN YOUR PATH.

CLASS METHODS
       LSF()
           Returns the LSF version string

       RaiseError( [ [ TRUE or FALSE ] ] )
           Controls whether LSF command line errors will be
           thrown. The default is FALSE. When called with no
           arguments returns the current value.

       PrintError( [ [ TRUE or FALSE ] ] )
           Controls printing to STDERR the stderr of the LSF com-
           mand line. The default is TRUE. When called with no
           arguments returns the current value.

       PrintOutput( [ [ TRUE or FALSE ] ] )
           Controls printing to STDOUT the stdout of the LSF com-
           mand line. The default is FALSE. When called with no
           arguments returns the current value.

HISTORY
       The LSF::Batch module on cpan didn't compile easily on all
       platforms i wanted.  The LSF API didn't seem very perlish
       either. As a quick fix I knocked these modules together
       which wrap the LSF command line interface. It was enough
       for my simple usage. Hopefully they work in a much more
       perly manner.
