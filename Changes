	 First release.

     Second release. Includes LSF::JobManager
      
0.21 Thu Apr 04 10:40:57 2002
     Simplified the test suite. A couple of things have been superceeded by the
     addition of LSF::JobManager (and i still need to write a proper test suite)

0.3  Thu Apr 04 17:20:55
     Now checks the version of LSF at startup. If it is version 4 then the 
     stdout/stderr of the bsub command is swapped. Required module System2 has
     problems when called in a BEGIN block so i have switched to IPC::Run
